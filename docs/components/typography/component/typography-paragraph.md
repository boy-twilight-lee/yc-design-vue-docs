      A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or
      system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result
      of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or
      process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
      In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit
      prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic
      design) may also be considered to be a design activity.
